To ICT Awards
My name is Andrea Toska and I am in Year 7 at Kings Tirana (6th grade, we use a british system.) First of all, thank you for the opportunity
you give to young people and especially to school students. I decided to participate as an applicant knowing that the ICT Awards
is the event and the best opportunity to showcase ideas and creativity. With this letter I apply (express my interest) for the opportunity
you have given us, a very valuable opportunity for us. I want to reach the top of my career over time and I am ready to try my best to achieve this.
I look forward to your reply!

All the best,

Andrea Toska.
